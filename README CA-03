CA-03

In this assignment about decision tree algorithms, we are using Python's DecisionTreeClassifier algorithm from the Scikit-learn package to train and test our model. 

US Census data was provided to be used for this assignment. It includes information on citizens' age, capital gain/loss, education, hours per week, marriage status and relationship, occupation, and race and sex. 

The specific data used can be found at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-03-Decision-Trees/master/census_data.csv

After training a decision tree algorithm using several different hyperparameters, a "best" tree classifier was created to optimize accuracy.

Using this "best" tree classifier, when a new individual was added to the census, the algorithm was then tested to predict the income of the invidual.
